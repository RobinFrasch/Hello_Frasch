# Hello Frasch

## HelloFresh Information

- taste, dietary restrictions, lifestyle preferences, culinary proficiency, dishes for larger groups
- onboarding: Tinder-like rating of recipes adjusted by preferences
- **issue:** missed filters and preferences because not prominent, smart filtering
- focus on enjoyable UX, customer experience
- data: focus create recipes/payloads - can provide dummy-data -> discord
- ML, Text2Speech, interactive/assistant, voice commands??
- tiktok style recipe videos(food porn)
- MVP: xx <--> emphasize next steps in demo
- mocked recipes in dc
- registration/login/setup preferences *not part of the challenge*

## HelloFresh Pitch

- Hook: general well-being, immune system
- Complete and balanced nutrition is important but hard -> who knows where to get Vitamin K from?
- products like Hello Fresh are here to help and we want to build on them tackle nutrition at its core
- Micro nutrients
- Some examples what vitamin K and B9 are useful for
- Go into Live demo:
- Hello Fresh already lets you filter for allergies and preferences in a manual way, can lead to deficiencx
- recommendations based on History, Season and Current Nutritional Needs
- If activate Nutrition Manager you can track the impact of meal choices on you micro nutrient levels
- Values are parsed from US Department of Agriculture -> legit bro
- Scale Up Potential
- Inferral of dietary preferences based on what meals are declined->based on that a recommended substitution those ingredients to maintain balanced micro nutrient levels
- Started development, but based on limited recipes currently available the resulting suggestions were pretty disgusting
  
- In a nutshell: HelloFresh, implement this feature or we all die
